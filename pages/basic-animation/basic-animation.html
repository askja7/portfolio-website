<h1>Theme 04: Basic Animation</h1>
<p>In the theme <i class="title">Basic Animation </i> we had to work on many small individual projects as well as group assignments. We were introduced the basic principles for the design and programming of digital solutions, with a particular focus on the design and structuring of the user interface.</p>
<h2>04.01.01 Sprite animation on a background</h2>
<img class="portfolio-images" alt="animation" src="images/sprite-animation/animation-on-bc.png"/>
<h3>Assignment’s focus:</h3>
<p>The aim is to design our own character and background, draw them in illustrator, make an animated sprite, and put everything together in css.</p>
<h3>What I learned:</h3>
<p>In this chapter of the module I learned how to create characters and what are the specifications of the different Character Archetypes. I decided to design a character who would be The Protagonist (The Hero). We learned about the importance of the basic shapes used for designing the characters - circle (friendly), triangle (evel), rectangle (strong). The design of my character is based on a circle shape which makes the character friendly and I used bright (happy) colors inspired from the animation series “Fruitties” and the game “Alto’s Adventure”.</p>
<p>I also learned about designing backgrounds and how to put everything together in  html and css. For this purpose we were introduced to css transitions and how to work with svg files and sprite.</p>

<h2>04.02.01 Javascript controlled animation</h2>
    <img class="portfolio-images" alt="prototype" src="images/prototype/prototype.png"/>
    <h3>Assignment’s focus:</h3>
<p>This was a group project. Our goal was to build a XD prototype of a mobile website using UI kit. The website should help new international students in Copenhagen to find accommodation. The provider of the site is the Danish government - the Ministry of Higher Education and Science.</p>
    <h3>My role in the project:</h3>
    <p>In this project my responsibilities were: conducting the research on conventions regarding design, content and functionality, as well as the research on digital communication targeted towards an international audience. I Also took part in conducting the ‘Think Aloud Test’.</p>
    <h3>What I learned:</h3>
    <p>I learned that by simplicity (using just a few colors and typefaces) and visual hierarchy in the design of the page, the user can find the necessary information quicker. Conventionality (as to the navigation bar and the filters) makes it even easier and more natural for the user to complete any desired action. I learned the importance of copy and microcopy in any digital product and how to use UI kits.</p>

    <h2>03.04.01 - Design sprint</h2>
    <img class="portfolio-images" alt="prototype" src="images/design-sprint/design-sprint-prototype.png"/>
    <h3>Assignment’s focus:</h3>
<p>This is a group project. The aim is to create a native app concept which would improve student life and studying for KEA students. Our app is called "Bridge the Gap". The idea of app is to enable peer-to-peer knowledge and skills exchange among KEA students.</p>
    <h3>My role in the project:</h3>
    <p>I was the main decider during the Design Sprint week. I was also in charge of creating the documentation file and the Style tile for the app and the second person in charge of the copy and microcopy. I also participated in the creation of the questions for the test.</p>
    <h3>What I learned:</h3>
    <p>The week was quite intense, I improved my multitasking skills and working under pressure. I learned how project organization and management works. I was introduced to team roles. I learned about all the steps in Design Sprint. I was introduced to mapping and pitching for the first time.</p>
