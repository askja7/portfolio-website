<h1>Theme 03: BASIC UX</h1>
<p>In the theme <i class="title">Basic UX </i> I learned how to understand the interaction between users and user interfaces. I also gained basic knowledge on what theories, tools and methods to use for research, design and testing a digital product in development. I used a selection of UX methods and learned how to present my product and to communicate my research.</p>
<h2>03.01.01 - Data collection</h2>
<img class="portfolio-images" alt="research" src="images/research.jpg"/>
<h3>Assignment’s focus:</h3>
<p>The focus is on individual and group exercises within research and analysis.</p>
<h3>What I learned:</h3>
<p>The topic I was focused on were “Lego used in the context of children’s learning” (Desk research), “A person you are allowed to observe while working” (Observation research), “A hobby or an interest” (Interview research) and “Learning Danish” (Servey research). I extended my knowledge on all four types of research, I learned how to aquire knowledge on a specific topic, how to define the targer group, how to plan and structure better all the steps in the process. After I completed the researches, I had to produce actual data and insights about what users do and why. I gained knowledge on how to present the results from my research in an easy and exciting way.</p>

<h2>03.03.01 - Prototype</h2>
    <img class="portfolio-images" alt="prototype" src="images/prototype/prototype.png"/>
    <h3>Assignment’s focus:</h3>
<p>This was a group project. Our goal was to build a XD prototype of a website using UI kit. The website should help new international students in Copenhagen to find accommodation. The provider of the site is the Danish government - the Ministry of Higher Education and Science. And the prototype should be in mobile version as it is meant to be accessed on laptop.</p>
    <h3>My role in the project:</h3>
    <p>In this project my responsibilities were: conducting the research on conventions regarding design, content and functionality, as well as the research on digital communication targeted towards an international audience. I Also took part in conducting the ‘Think Aloud Test’ and in creating the hi-fidelity prototype.</p>
    <h3>What I learned:</h3>
    <p>After conducting the needed research before implementing the prototype, I concluded that we need to go for simplicity in our design by using just a few colors and typefaces so the user could complete the needed actions quickly and it should be easy to find the necessary information. To make it even easier and more natural for the user to complete any desired action in our website, I decided that we need to use visual hierarchy as well as conventionality when it comes to navigation bar, filers when looking for accommodation and map of each location. Except of extending my knowledge and skills on research, I learned the importance of copy and microcopy in any digital product. I also learned how to use UI kits and extended my knowledge on prototyping in Adobe XD. </p>
