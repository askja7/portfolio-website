<p>My name is Lora. I was born in Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria. Most of my life I lived in Sofia (the capital of Bulgaria). But I also lived in Spain and Iceland. Currently I live in Denmark and study Multimedia Design and Communication in KEA â€“ Copenhagen School of Design and Technology.</p>
<p>I like Tea and I have a collection of different types of tea from around the world. I enjoy mountain biking and cycling in general. I like to spend time in the nature - hike mountains, camp, explore new places and cultures. I enjoy extreme activities and would like to get better in windsurfing. I also like more relaxing activities like knitting and glass painting.</p>
