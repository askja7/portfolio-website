<img class="about-image" alt="foodsharing" src="images/about/712.png"/>
<p>My name is Lora. I was born in Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria. Most of my life I lived in Sofia (the capital of Bulgaria). But I also lived in Spain and Iceland. Currently I live in Denmark and study Multimedia Design and Communication in KEA â€“ Copenhagen School of Design and Technology.</p>
    <p>I am curious to learn about all design-related topics but I would like to focus more on User Experience - reserach, concept development, aestethics and coding of digital solutions, where research and aesthetics interest me the most. I am also very keen on travel and landscape digital photography and I would like to expand that to travel-related video productions with focus on nature and extreme sports.</p>
<p>In my spare time I enjoy mountain biking and cycling in general. I like to spend time in the nature - hiking, camping, exploring new places. I like to devote more time to each place when I travel as I like exeperiencing the local life and culture to the fullest. I like sports, I enjoy extreme activities and would like to get better in windsurfing. I also like more relaxing activities like knitting and glass painting. And I would like to learn how to play the guitar. I am a Tea-lover and I have a collection of different types of tea from around the world.</p>
